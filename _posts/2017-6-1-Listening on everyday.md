W: Welcome to workplace (节目).

W: And in today's program, we were looking **at the** result**s** of two recently published surveys, Which both **deal with** same topic—**happiness** at work. John tells about the first surveys.

M: Well, this **was** done by a human resources **consultancy** who interview more than one thousand workers, and established a top ten of facts, which make people happy at work. The most important fact for the majority of people interviewed was having friendly, supported colleagues. In fact, 73% of people interviewed **put** the relationship with colleagues as a key factor, **contributing to happiness at work**, which is **a** very high percentage. The second most important factor was having a work that is enjoyable. The two **least** important factors were having one's achievements **recognized** and rather **surprisingly** earning a competitive salary. 

W: So, **we're** not mainly motivated by money?

M: Apparently, not.

W: Any other interesting information in the survey?

M: Yes, for example, 25% of the working people interviewed describe themselves **as** very happy at work. However, 20% of **employees** describe themselves **as** being unhappy. 

W: That is **quite** a lot **of unhappy** people at work every day. It is，isn't it?

M: And there are several more interesting conclusions **revealed** by the survey. First of all, small is **beautiful**. People definitely prefer working for smaller organization **or** company with **less** **than** one hundred staff. We also find out that, generally speaking, women were happier in **their** work than man. 

W: Yes, we are , aren't we？

M: **And** workers are **part-time** contrast, who only work **four or five** hours a day are happier than those who work **full times**. The researchers concluded that this is **probably** **due to** a better **work-life** balance.  

W:Are bosses happier than their employees?

M: Yes, perhaps not surprisingly ,the higher people go **in** a company, the happier they are. So senior managers enjoy their jobs more than people working under them.

W: Mr De Keyzer, I'm a great lover of your book **Moment Before the Flood.** Can you tell us how you first became interested in this subject matter?

M: In 2006, when the concert **hall** of **the city Bruges** **asked** me **to** take some pictures for a catalogue. For a new **concert season** around the **theme** of water I found myself walking along the Belgian coastline.
